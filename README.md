### Why participate in an Octernship with GitHub
Appwrite is an open-source project with a fast growing community. It started out as an open-source project a few years ago for the purpose of making software development easier and less complex to give developers a better starting point to build new projects. Our team is actively working with the fast-growing community to make Appwrite better.
In this role, you will have the opportunity to work as a Software Engineer and obtain the skills to become a better developer.


### Octernship role description
We're looking for a Software Engineer to join the Engineering team. This team is responsible for building reliable, performant, and scalable APIs and improve our new and existing product features.

In this role, you will create UI helper libraries to help developers implement authentication, realtime, and other Appwrite integrations with less code. The UI helper library can be for Web, Flutter, iOS, or Android platforms. Some inspiration can be found from Firebase firebase_ui_auth and Firebase UI for Web. Appwrite’s Pink design system can be used as inspiration for UI.

### Important Note
Working on the project serves as your application and it is unpaid. The payment is when you are selected as an official octern with Appwrite, joining as as an intern for 3 months.
